I’ve made a class that implements linked list where it adds, prints and removes node. 
So when i added the number 3,4,3 and then removed 4 it printed 3,3. And in the vectors 
I’ve made it of 3 numbers where it took 2,1,1 so 3 was inserted after 2 making it 2, 3, 1 
which was implemented by the function insertAfter.
